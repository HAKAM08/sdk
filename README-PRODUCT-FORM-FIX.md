# Product Form Fix Documentation

## Issue
The admin product form was not working correctly. When an admin filled out the form to add a new product, the product wasn't being added to the database.

## Root Causes

1. **Field Name Mismatches**: There were several mismatches between form field names and the database/model field names:
   - Form used `stock_quantity` but the database and controller expected `stock`
   - Form used `is_featured` but the database and model used `featured`
   - Form included an `is_active` field that doesn't exist in the database schema

2. **Missing Gallery Images Handling**: The controller wasn't properly handling the `additional_images` field that was present in the form.

3. **Missing Specifications Handling**: The controller wasn't properly handling the product specifications (attributes and attribute values).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Field Names in Create Form
- Changed `stock_quantity` to `stock`
- Changed `is_featured` to `featured`
- Removed the non-existent `is_active` field

### 2. Fixed Field Names in Edit Form
- Changed `stock_quantity` to `stock`
- Changed `is_featured` to `featured`
- Removed the non-existent `is_active` field

### 3. Updated Controller Validation
- Added validation for `additional_images.*`

### 4. Updated Controller Store Method
- Added code to handle `additional_images` upload
- Added `gallery_images` to the product creation array
- Added `featured` field to the product creation array
- Added code to handle product specifications (attributes and attribute values)

### 5. Updated Controller Update Method
- Added code to handle `additional_images` upload
- Added `gallery_images` to the product update array
- Added `featured` field to the product update array
- Added code to handle product specifications (attributes and attribute values)

### 6. Fixed Edit Form for Specifications
- Updated the edit form to correctly display existing product specifications
- Fixed the form to use the `attributeValues` relationship instead of a non-existent `specifications` property

## How to Test

1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to the Products section
3. Click "Add New Product"
4. Fill out the form with valid data, including:
   - Basic information (name, description)
   - Product images (main image and additional images)
   - Specifications (add at least one specification with name and value)
   - Pricing and inventory information
   - Category selection
5. Submit the form
6. Verify that the product is created successfully
7. Edit the product to verify that all fields are correctly saved and displayed, including:
   - All basic information
   - Images (main and additional)
   - Specifications (should show the ones you added)
   - Pricing and inventory information
   - Categories

## Additional Notes

- The `gallery_images` field is stored as a JSON array in the database
- The `featured` field is a boolean that determines if the product should be featured on the site
- Make sure the `images/products` directory exists and is writable by the web server
- Product specifications are stored using a many-to-many relationship between products and attribute values
- The system uses three tables for specifications:
  - `attributes`: Stores attribute names (e.g., "Weight", "Color")
  - `attribute_values`: Stores attribute values (e.g., "5.2 oz", "Blue")
  - `product_attribute_value`: Pivot table connecting products to attribute values
- When adding or editing a product, specifications are dynamically created or updated in these tables

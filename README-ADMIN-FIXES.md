# Admin Panel Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Login Redirect

**Problem:** When an admin user logs in, they were being redirected to the regular user page instead of the admin dashboard.

**Solution:** Updated the `LoginController.php` to check if the authenticated user is an admin and redirect them to the admin dashboard if they are.

```php
// In LoginController.php
public function login(Request $request)
{
    $credentials = $request->validate([
        'email' => ['required', 'email'],
        'password' => ['required'],
    ]);

    if (Auth::attempt($credentials, $request->boolean('remember'))) {
        $request->session()->regenerate();
        
        // Redirect admin users to admin dashboard
        if (Auth::user()->isAdmin()) {
            return redirect()->intended(route('admin.dashboard'));
        }
        
        return redirect()->intended(route('home'));
    }
}
```

### 2. Product Update Issue

**Problem:** When an admin tried to modify a product, it was being deleted instead of updated.

**Solution:** Fixed the HTML structure in the `edit.blade.php` file. The issue was that the delete form was nested inside the update form, causing the delete action to be triggered when submitting the update form.

The fix involved:
1. Properly closing the update form before the danger zone section
2. Moving the delete form outside of the update form
3. Ensuring proper HTML structure throughout the page

## How to Test

2. Verify that you are redirected to the admin dashboard instead of the regular user page

### Product Update
1. Go to the admin products section
2. Edit an existing product
